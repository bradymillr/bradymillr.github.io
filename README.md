### Multi-Command Troubleshooting Tool
[Project Link](https://github.com/bradymillr/Multi-CommandTroubleshootingTool)

This is a simple yet effective initial troubleshooting tool for device connectivity and network connection, instead of having to manually run ping, then nslookup, and then tracert/traceroute for example, you can run them all side by side! This saves you time and you can quickly compare the output against one another to determine where the issue lies. 

  
### Password Cracker Using Python 
[Project Link](https://github.com/bradymillr/PasswordCracker/blob/main/README.md)

This is a simple brute-force password cracker using python. NOTE: This method takes a very long time, so if you are interesting in testing this code, use 1-2 characters first. Two characters can take over 1,000 guesses.

### Password Generator Using Python 
[Project Link](https://github.com/bradymillr/PasswordGenerator/blob/main/README.md)

This is a password generator that will generate a password of any desired length and tell you how many brute force guesses it would roughly guess to crack.
