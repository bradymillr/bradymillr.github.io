### Projects
Pizza Sales Anaylsis
- [SQL/ReadMe](https://github.com/bradymillr/PizzaSalesAnalysis)
- In this project I used SQL to parse through data and answer two routine/cyclical questions that may be asked by a pizza shop owner or other departments. Additionally, I answered two more complicated questions to inform two suggestions for improving the business's profitability overall along with offering a new menu item.
